>>> Flaky Test
... 1.	Flaky test is condition of the test without changes the code when the result is passed or sometimes failed. A lot of flaky happen when timeouts, timeouts is very common in         web application. It could happen when the test is waiting for the process in the web and the connection become slower, then your test fail. Or sometimes like 3rd party             application such as database, when server is on the test passed, when server goes off the test failed.
... 2.	Using selenium we can add “Implicitly Wait()”, we can tell webdriver to wait if the element is not available immediately. But this wait will be place for entire time when         browser is open.
... 3.	CAPTCHA can be done by manual testing, the image showup’s randomly.
